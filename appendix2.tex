\section{Some examples}

To illustrate the effect of our approach, we provide a few mainline Linux
kernel commit ids\footnotemark[4] from our results.  Examples of true
positives not found by the other baselines ({\em cf.}
Figure \ref{fig:venn_diagram}) include 5567e989198b and 2e31b4cb895a.
Examples of false negatives found by at least one other baseline include
03f219041fdb and 56199016e867.  Most of PatchNet's top 100 false positives
appear to the authors to be stable-relevant patches that have been
overlooked by kernel maintainers.  Examples include e2bd416f6246 and
acf2dc2266b9.
