Figure~\ref{fig:patchnet} shows an overall framework of our PatchNet. Our tool accepts as input a set of patches, which contain both commit messages and commit code. The output of PatchNet is a list of predicted scores that reflects how likely the given patches are bug fixing patches. Our framework includes three main modules: the \textit{commit message module}, the \textit{commit code module}, and the \textit{classification module}.
