%Linux kernel stable versions serve the needs of users who value stability
%of the kernel over new features. The quality of such stable kernel versions
%depends on the initiative of kernel maintainers to propagate bug fixing
%patches to the stable versions. Thus, it is desirable to consider to what
%extent this process can be automated. A previous approach
%% based on Learning from Positive and Unlabeled Examples (SVM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
%relies on words from commit messages and a small set of manually constructed code
%features. This approach, however, shows only moderate accuracy.
%In this paper, we investigate whether deep learning can provide a more
%accurate solution. We propose PatchNet, a hierarchical deep learning-based approach that is capable of automatically extracting features from commit messages and commit code and using them to identify stable patches. PatchNet contains a deep hierarchical structure that mirrors the hierarchical and sequential structure of commit code, making it distinctive from the existing deep learning models on source code.
%% \ty{I add this sentence highlighting the novelty of PatchNet. James,pls verify this.} 
%Experiments on 82,403 recent Linux patches confirm the superiority of   
%PatchNet against various state-of-the-art baselines, including the one actively-used by Linux kernel maintainers. 
% The results show that PatchNet surpasses the best-performing baseline by 6.55\%, 7.8\%, and 6.3\% in terms of accuracy, F1, and AUC, respectively.

PatchNet accepts as input a set of patches to train a predicted model. We then apply the predicted model on a new set of patches to collect a list of predicted scores of given patches. Noticeably,
